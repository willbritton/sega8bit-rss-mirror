This repo simply mirrors the RSS feed from https://shinobiman.proboards.com/rss/public every 10 minutes, to the following URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willbritton/sega8bit-rss-mirror/refs/heads/main/public

I've had various problems with proboards.com blocking requests, in particular from my RSS client, so this is some kind of solution.
